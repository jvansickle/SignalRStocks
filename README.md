# SignalRStocks
SignalR Core example in Xamarin.Forms and .NET Core Web API

## Get it running
- To start the server, execute ```dotnet run --project SignalRStocks.Web``` from a terminal
- To run the Xamarin.Forms application, select the desired project (iOS or Android) as the VS startup project and run debug.
  - If you run the Android application, be sure to have an appropriate simulator configured. I recommend using android Studio
 to configure Android simulators.
